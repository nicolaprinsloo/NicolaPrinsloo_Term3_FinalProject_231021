This is my term 3 project in Interactive Development as a First Year student, where I learn more advanced javascript and jQuery. This project aims to create a modern, user-friendly website for an online booking system catering to a Cruise Liner company - Barbie Dream Boat Cruises. This system will empower users to effortlessly book cruise trips and access detailed journey information via an intuitive web form. I will employ JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS to build this interactive platform, ensuring a seamless user experience. Moreover, version control will be managed with Git, and an API integration will enhance user engagement.
